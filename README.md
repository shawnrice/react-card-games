React Card Games
===

Idea: lets make card games out of React.

Right now the repo just has some cards, defines a deck, and a shuffle mechanism. It would be great if we could create a few solitaire games in React.

Other Todos:
- [ ] Make CSS cards scaleable.
- [ ] Reduce svgs and create svg cardset
- [ ] Upgrade to react 16 and try to put in a canvas renderer
- [ ] Make games
